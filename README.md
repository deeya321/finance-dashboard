## State Management

The application uses Redux Toolkit with the following slices:

- `filters`: UI filtering state
- `theme`: Application theme (light/dark)
- `role`: User role/permissions (if applicable)

## Theming

The app supports both light and dark themes. Theme preference is saved to `localStorage` and persists across sessions.

Toggle theme via the UI or programmatically:
```javascript
// Dark mode
document.documentElement.classList.add('dark')

// Light mode
document.documentElement.classList.remove('dark')
```

## Styling

This project uses Tailwind CSS for styling. Custom configuration is available in `tailwind.config.js`. The app uses a dark mode strategy based on the `class` selector.
